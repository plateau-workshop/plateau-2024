<div class="header lead">PLATEAU Overview</div>

<div class="no-top-padding">
  <p class="no-top-padding">
    The PLATEAU workshop covers all topics at the intersection of PL and HCI. It
    brings together expertise on the usability of programming languages and
    tools with expertise on how the programming languages toolbox can be used in
    service of HCI goals.
  </p>
</div>

<b>Paper formats:</b>
<ul>
  <li>4-page short papers</li>
  <li>10-page long papers</li>
  <li>5- to 9-page flex length papers</li>
</ul>

<div class="header lead">What to Submit</div>

<div>
  <p>
    We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works&#8212;for
    instance, papers that describe works-in-progress or recently completed work,
    report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging
    open problems, or propose speculative new approaches. In short, a PLATEAU
    submission should describe work or perspectives on which the authors want to
    receive feedback or which they believe will trigger interesting conversation
    at the workshop.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="header lead">Topics</div>

<div>
  <p>Some particular areas of interest are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>empirical studies of programming languages</li>
    <li>methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation</li>
    <li>
      software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language

  </ul>

  <p>
    PLATEAU is interested in a broad range of topics, and this list is not
    exhaustive. If you think your work might interest the PLATEAU community,
    please submit!
  </p>

<div class="header lead">Format</div>

<div>
  <p>
    We accept papers in a range of lengths. Short papers may be up to 4 pages.
    Long papers may be up to 10 pages. Flex-length papers may be any length in
    between!
  </p>

  <p>
    Submissions should use the
    <a href="assets/LaTeX/PLATEAU_LaTeX.zip">PLATEAU LaTeX class</a>. Please
    also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and
    white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and
    font sizes are legible.
  </p>

  <div class="header lead">Proceedings</div>
  <p>
    The PLATEAU proceedings will be archived in Carnegie Mellon University's
    <a href="https://kilthub.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">KiltHub repository</a>. Included papers
    will be freely available (open access), have independent
    <a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOIs</a>, and be indexed by Google Scholar.
    There will be no publication fee for authors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Papers will be included in the PLATEAU proceedings at the authors’
    discretion. If you anticipate publishing the same work at an additional
    venue that has double-publication restrictions, we are happy to withhold
    papers from the proceedings. We strongly encourage you to submit your
    PLATEAU papers to top-tier HCI and PL venues after receiving feedback from
    the PLATEAU community!

  <div class="header lead">Reviewing and Mentoring Process</div>
  <p>
    All submitted papers will be reviewed by the organizing committee to ensure that they are appropriate for PLATEAU. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present at the workshop. In addition, each accepted paper will be matched with one mentor from PLATEAU's mentoring panel. The mentor will provide detailed constructive feedback on the paper.
  </p>


  <div class="header lead">In-Person PLATEAU</div>

  <p>
    The full PLATEAU experience is currently only possible in person, so we
    encourage attendees and authors to come to Pittsburgh for the event.
    However, we understand some individuals may not be able to travel for a
    variety of reasons. If you cannot come to Pittsburgh but still wish to
    participate in PLATEAU, please email us at
    <span class="email">plateau-chairs@googlegroups.com</span> to discuss
    options.
    Note: We’re keeping an eye on the news.  We’ll post any updates to PLATEAU’s format here on the website if the public health situation makes the current in-person plan impossible.
