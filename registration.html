  We have <a href="https://reservations.travelclick.com/17233?groupID=4132987">a block of rooms</a> reserved at the Hotel Shattuck Plaza in downtown Berkeley. Rooms in the block are available on a "first come, first served" basis, 
  so plan to make your reservations sooner rather than later! You must also book no later than Thursday, January 4 in order to receive the group rate!  
  So again, try to get your reservations in as soon as possible! If you need additional nights beyond the suggested dates, please call or email
